 Multi-Level Single-Linkage (MLSL) algorithm for
 global optimization by random local optimizations (a multistart algorithm
 with "clustering" to avoid repeated detection of the same local minimum),
 modified to optionally use a Sobol' low-discrepancy sequence (LDS) instead
 of pseudorandom numbers.  See:
 .
 A. H. G. Rinnooy Kan and G. T. Timmer, "Stochastic global optimization
 methods," Mathematical Programming, vol. 39, p. 27-78 (1987).
 [ actually 2 papers -- part I: clustering methods (p. 27), then
 part II: multilevel methods (p. 57) ]
 .
 and also:
 .
 Sergei Kucherenko and Yury Sytsko, "Application of deterministic
 low-discrepancy sequences in global optimization," Computational
 Optimization and Applications, vol. 30, p. 297-318 (2005).
 .
 Compared to the above papers, I made a couple other modifications
 to the algorithm besides the use of a LDS.
 .
 1) first, the original algorithm suggests discarding points
 within a *fixed* distance of the boundaries or of previous
 local minima; I changed this to a distance that decreases with,
 iteration, proportional to the same threshold radius used
 for clustering.  (In the case of the boundaries, I make
 the proportionality constant rather small as well.)
 .
 2) Kan and Timmer suggest using fancy "spiral-search" algorithms
 to quickly locate nearest-neighbor points, reducing the
 overall time for N sample points from O(N^2) to O(N log N)
 However, recent papers seem to show that such schemes (kd trees,
 etcetera) become inefficient for high-dimensional spaces (d > 20),
 and finding a better approach seems to be an open question.  Therefore,
 since I am mainly interested in MLSL for high-dimensional problems
 (in low dimensions we have DIRECT etc.), I punted on this question
 for now.  In practice, O(N^2) (which does not count the #points
 evaluated in local searches) does not seem too bad if the objective
 function is expensive.

 In this file we implement Svanberg's CCSA algorithm with the
 simple linear approximation + quadratic penalty function.
 .
 We also allow the user to specify an optional "preconditioner": an
 approximate Hessian (which must be symmetric & positive
 semidefinite) that can be added into the approximation.  [X. Liang
 and I went through the convergence proof in Svanberg's paper
 and it does not seem to be modified by such preconditioning, as
 long as the preconditioner eigenvalues are bounded above for all x.]
 .
 For the non-preconditioned case the trust-region subproblem is
 separable and can be solved by a dual method.  For the preconditioned
 case the subproblem is still convex but in general is non-separable
 so we solve by calling the same algorithm recursively, under the
 assumption that the subproblem objective is cheap to evaluate.

 Fortran API wrappers, using the F77 macro defined in f77api.c.
 This header file is #included one or more times from f77api.c
 in order to define verions of the Fortran API for various compilers.
 .
 All of the functions in this file have underscores in their names,
 which means that they are treated differently for name-mangling
 (thank you, g77 and f2c) than names without underscores.
 .
 The return value of a function is converted to the first argument
 of a subroutine.

 Generation of Sobol sequences in up to 1111 dimensions, based on the
 algorithms described in:
 P. Bratley and B. L. Fox, Algorithm 659, ACM Trans.
 Math. Soft. 14 (1), 88-100 (1988),
 as modified by:
 S. Joe and F. Y. Kuo, ACM Trans. Math. Soft 29 (1), 49-57 (2003).
 .
 Note that the code below was written without even looking at the
 Fortran code from the TOMS paper, which is only semi-free (being
 under the restrictive ACM copyright terms).  Then I went to the
 Fortran code and took out the table of primitive polynomials and
 starting direction #'s ... since this is just a table of numbers
 generated by a deterministic algorithm, it is not copyrightable.
 (Obviously, the format of these tables then necessitated some
 slight modifications to the code.)
 .
 For the test integral of Joe and Kuo (see the main() program
 below), I get exactly the same results for integrals up to 1111
 dimensions compared to the table of published numbers (to the 5
 published significant digits).
 .
 This is not to say that the authors above should not be credited for
 their clear description of the algorithm (and their tabulation of
 the critical numbers).  Please cite them.  Just that I needed
 a free/open-source implementation.
